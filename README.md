# Cooler_System_cpp
The Main Principle of the Project is to switch on the fan connected to DC-Motor when the temperature is greater than a threshold value.
The System is work on three threshold levels which corresponding to three levels of fan speed.
included in the repository Atmel Microship project file and proteus simulation file.
This system used in home applications and in cpu to reduse heat.
